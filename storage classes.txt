-auto
-register
-static
-extern

auto--> by default all the local variables has auto storage class.

int a;

auto int a;


- register--> this storage class is used to define local variables that should stored in a register instead of RAM. 


register int a;

note that defining register does not mean that variable will be stored in a register. It means that it might be stored in a register depending on hardware & implementation restrictions.


static--> static is used on a global variable it causes only one copy of that member to be shared by all the objects of its class.


static int a=10;

t1,t2;

t1.a++;-->11

t2.a-->11


-extern--> this modifier is most commonly used when there are two or more files sharing the same global variables or functions.


extern int a=200;
